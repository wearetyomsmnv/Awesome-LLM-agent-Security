<h3 align="center">Basic Concepts</h3>

### LLM Agent - is an intelligent system used by a large language model to perform tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> **MultiAgent**: When there is an ensemble of many agents that perform one large task - this is called a multi-agent system. It is based on a large language model that is responsible for task planning and decision making.

---

### Memory

Memory in autonomous agents can be categorized into two main types:

‚Ä¢ Short-Term Memory: This refers to the agent's ability to utilize in-context learning, where it retains information temporarily during a single interaction. This is often limited by the model's context window, which restricts the amount of information it can process at once.

‚Ä¢ Long-Term Memory: This allows the agent to store and recall information over extended periods. Long-term memory is typically managed through external vector stores, enabling the agent to retrieve relevant information quickly. This capability is crucial for tasks that require knowledge accumulation and recall over time.

Memory plays a vital role in how agents learn from past experiences, refine their actions, and improve their performance in future tasks.

---

### Planning
Planning involves the agent's ability to break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals. This process can be enhanced through various techniques:

Task Decomposition: The agent can decompose a large task into smaller, more manageable steps. Techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting encourage the model to think step-by-step, making it easier to tackle complex problems.

Self-Reflection: Agents can evaluate their past actions, learn from mistakes, and refine their strategies. This iterative process helps improve decision-making and planning over time.

External Planning Tools: Some agents may utilize classical planning methods, such as the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), to generate structured plans based on predefined domains.

Effective planning is essential for agents to navigate complex tasks and adapt to changing circumstances.

---

### Action
Action refers to the execution of tasks based on the agent's planning and memory. This involves:

Tool Use: Agents can interact with external APIs and tools to gather information, execute code, or perform specific functions that extend their capabilities beyond what is encoded in their model weights.

ReAct Framework: This framework integrates reasoning and action, allowing agents to generate reasoning traces alongside their actions. This helps in understanding the rationale behind decisions and improving future actions.

Dynamic Interaction: Agents can adapt their actions based on real-time observations and feedback from their environment, allowing for more responsive and intelligent behavior.
